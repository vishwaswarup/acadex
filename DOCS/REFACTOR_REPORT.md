# Acadex Refactor Report

## Overview
Successfully fixed teacher dashboard errors and refactored the entire codebase for better organization, scalability, and maintainability.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Teacher Dashboard Errors ✅
**Problem**: Multiple teacher dashboard files causing routing conflicts
- `/app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx` (main)
- `/app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` (duplicate)
- Auth system redirected to `/teacher/dashboard` but main dashboard was at `/dashboard/teacher`

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate `/app/teacher/` directory
- Fixed auth routing to use `/dashboard/teacher` consistently
- Consolidated teacher dashboard logic into single file

### 2. Code Organization Issues ✅
**Problem**: Duplicate components and inconsistent structure
- Components in both `/components/` and `/src/components/`
- Mixed import patterns (`/src/` vs root)
- Dead fitness-related code still present

**Solution**:
- Removed entire `/src/` directory and consolidated to root `/components/`
- Removed all fitness-related components and utilities
- Standardized all imports to use root paths with `@/` alias

### 3. Authentication Flow Issues ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent role-based routing and user experience
- Users without roles had no clear path
- Auth redirects were inconsistent
- No role selection mechanism

**Solution**:
- Added role selection screen for new users
- Fixed auth routing to be consistent across the app
- Improved user experience with clear role-based navigation

## Files Changed

2. **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** - Added role selection UI and fixed routing logic
3. **`hooks/useAuth.ts`** - Fixed routing paths and removed default role assignment
4. **`lib/types/index.ts`** - Added admin role support and made role optional
5. **`components/common/Navigation.tsx`** - Added dynamic navigation based on user role
6. **`app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx`** - Fixed grading functionality and removed duplicate listeners

### New Files Created
1. **`app/assignments/page.tsx`** - Dedicated assignments list page for students
2. **`app/settings/page.tsx`** - User settings and profile management
3. **`lib/services/assignmentService.ts`** - Centralized API service layer
4. **`lib/hooks/useAssignments.ts`** - Custom hooks for assignment data management
5. **`next.config.js`** - Next.js configuration

## Architectural Improvements

### 1. Service Layer Pattern
- Created `AssignmentService` class for centralized API calls
- Separated business logic from UI components
- Easier testing and maintenance

### 2. Custom Hooks Pattern
- `useStudentAssignments()` - Manages student assignment data
- `useTeacherAssignments()` - Manages teacher assignment data
- Reusable logic across components

### 3. Role-Based Architecture
- Dynamic navigation based on user role
- Extensible for future roles (admin, etc.)
- Clean separation of concerns

### 4. Consistent File Organization

```

## Key Features Added

### 1. Role Selection System
- New users can choose between Student and Teacher roles
- Existing users with roles are automatically routed
- Clean UI with role-specific icons and descriptions

### 2. Enhanced Navigation
- Dynamic navigation items based on user role
- Students see: Dashboard, Assignments
- Teachers see: Dashboard, Create Assignment
- Consistent active state management

### 3. Grading System
- Fixed grading modal integration
- Proper error handling for grade submissions
- Real-time updates after grading

### 4. Settings Page
- User profile management
- Role display
- Sign out functionality

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Authentication Flow
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Click "Sign in" → Register new account
# Choose Student or Teacher role
# Verify redirect to appropriate dashboard
```

### 2. Student Dashboard
```bash
# Login as student
# Should see: assignments list, submission status, demo data if no real assignments
# Click "View Details" on assignment → should navigate to assignment detail page
# Click "Submit" → should open submission modal
```

### 3. Teacher Dashboard
```bash
# Login as teacher  
# Should see: assignments overview, submissions list, demo data if no real assignments
# Click "Create Assignment" → should navigate to assignment creation
# Click "Grade" on submission → should open grading modal
```

### 4. Navigation
```bash
# Verify navigation shows appropriate items based on role
# Student: Dashboard, Assignments
# Teacher: Dashboard, Create
# Active states should work correctly
```

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Reduced Bundle Size
- Removed unused dependencies (react-router-dom, playwright from deps)
- Eliminated duplicate components
- Cleaned up unused imports

### 2. Better Data Management
